## ZippyShare .com Description

![ZippyShare Front Page](img/ZippyShare.png)

ZippyShare.com was incorporated in 2006, with the intention of providing a lightweight and user-fiendly file sharing solution.

With it's maximum upload limit as 500 MB, it is certainly aimed at the more casual and leisure-oriented user. This certainly tallies with its reputation as a music-sharing platfrom, as tis figure means that any blue-ray disc shared via ZippyShare would need to be split into 50 parts - which isn't feasible!

Many users of ZippyShare have complained about its automatic deleting of the files following 30 days of inactivity. This is certainly something that you wouldn't expect from the big names on the market, such as DropBox. However, this is actually rather common across the industry, certainly with the smaller file-sharing services.

While it should also be noted that this is a very basic platform compared to others that are available, some users of ZippyShare have also complained about the levels of privacy available.

ZippyShare has intention of providing user-friendly file sharing solution, but many users prefer to use other platforms to share files because the User Inferface (UI) of Zippyshare is unattractive and sometimes does not work or work but on certain pages.
